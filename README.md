This is the repo for the [Helsinki Scala Club](http://www.meetup.com/Scala-Helsinki/) meetups.

We run the meetup off the GitHub, pretty literally.

## Profile

Meetings are Thu 6-7:30 pm (often first Thursday of a month), in a restaurant or pub in central Helsinki area.
The meeting will be strictly time boxed so show up in time. :)

Meetings can be sponsored by like-minded companies. If they are not, everyone pays their own drinks & snacks.

Open / approachable for both Scala beginners / advanced alike. General programming knowledge (of any language, not
necessarily Scala) is expected.

A computer is always available for hands-on coding, which is preferred over slides. [IntelliJ IDEA CE](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/) + git clone of this repo.

Each evening has a specific, pre-selected theme regarding Scala.
