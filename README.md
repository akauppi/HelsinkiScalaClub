This is the repo for the [Helsinki Scala Club](http://www.meetup.com/Scala-Helsinki/) meetups.

We run the meetup off the GitHub, pretty literally.

## Profile

- meetings Thu 6-7:30 pm (often first Thu of a month), in a restaurant/pub, in central Helsinki area
  - the meeting will be strictly time boxed so be in time :)
- open / approachable for both Scala beginners / advanced alike
  - general programming knowledge is expected
- a computer is always available for hands on coding (which is preferred over slides)
  - with [IntelliJ IDEA CE](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/) + git clone of this repo
- each evening will have a specific, pre-selected theme

All the code samples end up in the repo, so cloning the repo gives you the history of the meetups.
